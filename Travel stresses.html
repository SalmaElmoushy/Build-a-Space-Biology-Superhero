        <p class="question">What stresses does your body face when being on a trip to space ?</p>
        <p class="tab">Most people think that astronauts ' job is all fun as they get to explore new things and live an extremely unique experience that not many can go through , which is right ! </p>
        <p class="tab">Nevertheless , astronauts actually face a lot of hardships , whether those hardships are mentally or physically . The change of the normal circumstances that our body is designed to live in , horribly changes the functions of our body's organs .</p>
        <p class="tab">A human body functions best while being on Earth , because of air pressure , gravity , good nutrition , and being exposed to just the right amount and type of radiation that passes through Earth's atmosphere .</p>
        <p class="tab">Let's take a quick glance at the differences between humans ' shapes among their different races , those differences between us doesn't only make everyone has his / her own type of beauty , but they also play a great role in making us adaptable to the environment that we live in !</p>
        <p class="tab">First, we’ll discuss the changes to the body when going on a trip to space and their causes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Space anemia: As we know, blood represents 7% of a human’s body weight. It is responsible for transporting nutrition, gases, and wastes. Blood consists of three components, which are: red blood cells; white blood cells; and plasma. Focusing on the RBCs, our body loses 2 million RBCs per second while in normal circumstances. The bone marrow, which is responsible for producing new ones, can easily compensate for this amount. However, in space, the body is being put into harder circumstances where gravity doesn’t help in blood circulation and is offered fewer fluids. The body loses 3 million RBCs per second, which is more than the normal loss by 50%! Of course, the body isn’t able to compensate for this amount, leading to "space anemia".</li>
            <li>The heart’s ability to bump blood</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="tab">Let’s take a quick glance at the differences in human shapes among different races. Those differences between us don’t only make everyone have his/her own type of beauty, but they also play a great role in making us adaptable to the environment that we live in!</p>
